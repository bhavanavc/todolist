Simple Python To-Do List Manager
This project is a beginner-friendly command line to-do list manager in Python. 
It allows users to add tasks, view all tasks, mark tasks as done, erase all tasks, and exit the application- all via an interactive text menu.

Features-
Add tasks: ENter and save new to-do list items.
View tasks: Display the current list of tasks with their status("pending" or "done").
Marks task as done: Select a specific task to mark as completed.
Erase all tasks: CLear all items after confirmation.
Exit : End the program.

How it Works
Each task is stored in a Python list as a tuple where status is either "Pending" or "Done". The flow is managed with simple loops and if-else conditions.
These features make it easy to to understand or modify for new features.

python todolist.py
